In December, we launched our first natively multimodal model Gemini 1.0 in three sizes: Ultra, Pro and Nano. Just a few months later we released 1.5 Pro, with enhanced performance and a breakthrough long context window of 1 million tokens.Developers and enterprise customers have been putting 1.5 Pro to use in incredible ways and finding its long context window, multimodal reasoning capabilities and impressive overall performance incredibly useful.We know from user feedback that some applications need lower latency and a lower cost to serve. This inspired us to keep innovating, so today, we’re introducing Gemini 1.5 Flash: a model that’s lighter-weight than 1.5 Pro, and designed to be fast and efficient to serve at scale.Both 1.5 Pro and 1.5 Flash are available in public preview with a 1 million token context window in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. And now, 1.5 Pro is also available with a 2 million token context window via waitlist to developers using the API and to Google Cloud customers.We’re also introducing updates across the Gemini family of models, announcing our next generation of open models, Gemma 2, and sharing progress on the future of AI assistants, with Project Astra.Context lengths of leading foundation models compared with Gemini 1.5’s 2 million token capability1.5 Flash is the newest addition to the Gemini model family and the fastest Gemini model served in the API. It’s optimized for high-volume, high-frequency tasks at scale, is more cost-efficient to serve and features our breakthrough long context window.While it’s a lighter weight model than 1.5 Pro, it’s highly capable of multimodal reasoning across vast amounts of information and delivers impressive quality for its size.The new Gemini 1.5 Flash model is optimized for speed and efficiency, is highly capable of multimodal reasoning and features our breakthrough long context window.1.5 Flash excels at summarization, chat applications, image and video captioning, data extraction from long documents and tables, and more. This is because it’s been trained by 1.5 Pro through a process called “distillation,” where the most essential knowledge and skills from a larger model are transferred to a smaller, more efficient model.Read more about 1.5 Flash in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report, on the Gemini technology page, and learn about 1.5 Flash’s availability and pricing.Over the last few months, we’ve significantly improved 1.5 Pro, our best model for general performance across a wide range of tasks.Beyond extending its context window to 2 million tokens, we’ve enhanced its code generation, logical reasoning and planning, multi-turn conversation, and audio and image understanding through data and algorithmic advances. We see strong improvements on public and internal benchmarks for each of these tasks.1.5 Pro can now follow increasingly complex and nuanced instructions, including ones that specify product-level behavior involving role, format and style. We’ve improved control over the model’s responses for specific use cases, like crafting the persona and response style of a chat agent or automating workflows through multiple function calls. And we’ve enabled users to steer model behavior by setting system instructions.We added audio understanding in the Gemini API and Google AI Studio, so 1.5 Pro can now reason across image and audio for videos uploaded in Google AI Studio. And we’re now integrating 1.5 Pro into Google products, including Gemini Advanced and in Workspace apps.Read more about 1.5 Pro in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report and on the Gemini technology page.Gemini Nano is expanding beyond text-only inputs to include images as well. Starting with Pixel, applications using Gemini Nano with Multimodality will be able to understand the world the way people do — not just through text, but also through sight, sound and spoken language.Read more about Gemini 1.0 Nano on Android.Today, we’re also sharing a series of updates to Gemma, our family of open models built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models.We’re announcing Gemma 2, our next generation of open models for responsible AI innovation. Gemma 2 has a new architecture designed for breakthrough performance and efficiency, and will be available in new sizes.The Gemma family is also expanding with PaliGemma, our first vision-language model inspired by PaLI-3. And we’ve upgraded our Responsible Generative AI Toolkit with LLM Comparator for evaluating the quality of model responses.Read more on the Developer blog.As part of Google DeepMind’s mission to build AI responsibly to benefit humanity, we’ve always wanted to develop universal AI agents that can be helpful in everyday life. That’s why today, we’re sharing our progress in building the future of AI assistants with Project Astra (advanced seeing and talking responsive agent).To be truly useful, an agent needs to understand and respond to the complex and dynamic world just like people do — and take in and remember what it sees and hears to understand context and take action. It also needs to be proactive, teachable and personal, so users can talk to it naturally and without lag or delay.While we’ve made incredible progress developing AI systems that can understand multimodal information, getting response time down to something conversational is a difficult engineering challenge. Over the past few years, we’ve been working to improve how our models perceive, reason and converse to make the pace and quality of interaction feel more natural.Building on Gemini, we’ve developed prototype agents that can process information faster by continuously encoding video frames, combining the video and speech input into a timeline of events, and caching this information for efficient recall.By leveraging our leading speech models, we also enhanced how they sound, giving the agents a wider range of intonations. These agents can better understand the context they’re being used in, and respond quickly, in conversation.With technology like this, it’s easy to envision a future where people could have an expert AI assistant by their side, through a phone or glasses. And some of these capabilities are coming to Google products, like the Gemini app and web experience, later this year.We’ve made incredible progress so far with our family of Gemini models, and we’re always striving to advance the state-of-the-art even further. By investing in a relentless production line of innovation, we’re able to explore new ideas at the frontier, while also unlocking the possibility of new and exciting Gemini use cases.Learn more about Gemini and its capabilities.

<span class="gs">**Based on Section 2 of "Factorization and Compositional Generalization in Diffusion Models"**</span>

If you have ever typed "an astronaut riding a horse on Mars" into DALL-E 2 or Stable Diffusion and watched a masterpiece appear, you have witnessed the power of <span class="gs">**Diffusion Models**</span>. But how do they turn random static into art?

In this post, we will walk through the core logic of these models—from the math of "destroying" data to the state-of-the-art architectures that reconstruct it.
<span class="p">
---
</span>
<span class="gu">## 2.1 Formulations of Diffusion Models</span>

The intuition behind diffusion models is surprisingly simple: <span class="gs">**destroy the data, then learn to fix it**</span>. Formally, there are three main ways to describe this process.

<span class="gu">### 2.1.1 Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs)</span>
This is the most common framework. Imagine taking a crisp photo ($x_0$) and slowly adding "snow" (Gaussian noise) to it over many steps ($t=1, ..., T$).

<span class="gs">**The Forward Process (Destruction)**</span>
We add noise iteratively using a <span class="gs">**Markov chain**</span>, meaning each step only depends on the previous one. We use a "transition kernel" $q$ to add this noise:

$$q(x_t | x_{t-1}) = <span class="se">\m</span>athcal{N}(x_t; <span class="se">\s</span>qrt{1 - <span class="se">\b</span>eta_t}x_{t-1}, <span class="se">\b</span>eta_t I)$$

Here, $<span class="se">\b</span>eta_t$ tells us how much noise to add. Eventually, at step $T$, the image is destroyed—it is just pure Gaussian noise ($x_T <span class="se">\a</span>pprox <span class="se">\m</span>athcal{N}(0, I)$).
<span class="gt">
&gt; **Figure 2.1 Visualization:** Imagine a sequence of images. On the far left is a cat. As you move right, the image becomes grainier. On the far right, it looks like a TV tuned to a dead channel. That is the forward process.</span>

<span class="gs">**The Backward Process (Creation)**</span>
The generative magic happens in reverse. The model learns to reverse time, starting from noise and removing it step-by-step to recover the image. A neural network predicts the mean ($<span class="se">\m</span>u_<span class="se">\t</span>heta$) and variance ($<span class="se">\S</span>igma_<span class="se">\t</span>heta$) for the reverse step:

$$p_<span class="se">\t</span>heta(x_{t-1} | x_t) = <span class="se">\m</span>athcal{N}(x_{t-1}; <span class="se">\m</span>u_<span class="se">\t</span>heta(x_t, t), <span class="se">\S</span>igma_<span class="se">\t</span>heta(x_t, t))$$

<span class="gs">**The Objective**</span>
How do we train it? We basically teach the neural network ($<span class="se">\e</span>psilon_<span class="se">\t</span>heta$) to look at a noisy image and <span class="gs">**guess the noise**</span> that was added to it. The loss function measures how close the guess is to the real noise:

$$L = <span class="se">\m</span>athbb{E} [ ||<span class="se">\e</span>psilon - <span class="se">\e</span>psilon_<span class="se">\t</span>heta(x_t, t)||^2 ]$$

<span class="gu">### 2.1.2 Score-based Generative Models (SGMs)</span>
Instead of predicting noise directly, SGMs estimate the <span class="gs">**score function**</span>: the gradient of the log-density of the data ($<span class="se">\n</span>abla_x <span class="se">\l</span>og p(x)$).
To generate an image, we use <span class="gs">**Langevin Dynamics**</span>. We start with a random point (noise) and iteratively move it toward high-density regions (real data) using the estimated score.

<span class="gu">### 2.1.3 Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs)</span>
If we add noise in infinite, tiny steps rather than discrete ones, the process becomes continuous.
<span class="p">*</span>   <span class="gs">**Forward:**</span> Described by a differential equation $dx = f(x, t)dt + g(t)dw$.
<span class="p">*</span>   <span class="gs">**Reverse:**</span> Solved using a "probability flow ODE" to turn noise back into data.
<span class="p">

</span>
<span class="gu">## 2.2 Conditional Diffusion Models</span>

Generating random images is fun, but usually, we want control (e.g., "generate a <span class="ge">*dog*</span>"). We achieve this by feeding a condition vector $c$ (like a class label or text embedding) into the model,.

There are two main ways to guide the AI:

<span class="gu">### 2.2.1 Classifier Guidance</span>
This method uses a separate <span class="gs">**classifier**</span> trained to identify noisy images. If you want a "cat," the classifier looks at the current noisy image and calculates the gradient to push the image to look more like a cat ($<span class="se">\n</span>abla_{x_t} <span class="se">\l</span>og p_<span class="se">\p</span>hi(c | x_t)$). We subtract this gradient from the noise prediction,.

<span class="gu">### 2.2.2 Classifier-free Guidance</span>
This is the method used by modern giants like DALL-E 2. Instead of a separate classifier, we train the diffusion model to handle both specific prompts ($c$) and unconditional inputs (by dropping the label, $c=<span class="se">\e</span>mptyset$).
During generation, we mix the two predictions. We push the model away from the "unconditional" result and toward the "conditional" result using a guidance weight $w$:

$$<span class="se">\t</span>ilde{<span class="se">\e</span>psilon}_<span class="se">\t</span>heta(x_t, c) = (1 + w)<span class="se">\e</span>psilon_<span class="se">\t</span>heta(x_t, c) - w<span class="se">\e</span>psilon_<span class="se">\t</span>heta(x_t)$$

This makes the images stick much closer to your text prompt!
<span class="p">

</span>
<span class="gu">## 2.3 Text-to-Image Generative Models</span>

How are these mathematical principles applied in the real world?

<span class="gu">### 2.3.1 Pixel-based Models</span>
These models work directly on the high-resolution pixels.
<span class="p">*</span>   <span class="gs">**GLIDE (OpenAI):**</span> Uses classifier-free guidance to generate photorealistic images. It showed that we don't need complex separate classifiers to get great results.
<span class="p">*</span>   <span class="gs">**Imagen (Google):**</span> This model made a huge discovery—<span class="gs">**the text encoder matters more than the image generator**</span>. By using a massive Large Language Model (T5-XXL) to understand the prompt, Imagen could generate highly accurate concepts.
<span class="gt">
&gt; **Figure 2.4 Example:** Imagen can generate a "brain riding a rocketship heading towards the moon" or "a dragon fruit wearing a karate belt." This proves it "understands" the text deeply.</span>

<span class="gu">### 2.3.2 Latent-based Models</span>
Working with pixels is slow and expensive. <span class="gs">**Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs)**</span> solve this by compressing images into a smaller "latent space" (using an Autoencoder) and doing the diffusion there.
<span class="p">*</span>   <span class="gs">**Stable Diffusion:**</span> Based on LDM. It uses <span class="gs">**cross-attention**</span> to inject text prompts into the generation process. Because it runs in a compressed space, it is incredibly efficient.
<span class="p">*</span>   <span class="gs">**DALL-E 2 (unCLIP):**</span> Uses OpenAI's <span class="gs">**CLIP**</span> model. It first converts text into a CLIP image embedding, then decodes that embedding into an image.
<span class="gt">
&gt; **Figure 2.5 Architecture:** Think of LDM as a sandwich. The top and bottom bread are the Encoder and Decoder (handling pixels). The meat in the middle is the Diffusion Process, operating in the efficient, compressed Latent Space,.</span>

<span class="gu">### 2.3.3 Failure Modes</span>
Even these powerful models make funny mistakes. Section 2.3.3 highlights several "failures" that reveal how the models think:
<span class="p">
1.</span>  <span class="gs">**Binding Issues:**</span> If you ask for a "red cube on a blue cube," DALL-E 2 often mixes them up (e.g., a blue cube on a red cube). It struggles to "bind" the attribute (color) to the correct object.
<span class="p">2.</span>  <span class="gs">**Text Generation:**</span> If you ask for a sign that says "Deep Learning," the model might produce gibberish like "Diep Lerpt." It mimics the <span class="ge">*look*</span> of letters but doesn't fully understand spelling,.
<span class="p">3.</span>  <span class="gs">**Unusual Scenarios:**</span> Ask GLIDE for a "car with triangular wheels," and it will likely draw circular wheels. The model is biased by its training data—it has seen millions of round wheels and refuses to believe triangles can roll!.
<span class="p">4.</span>  <span class="gs">**Physics Violations:**</span> Reflections in mirrors sometimes show the wrong object or angle, proving the model lacks a true 3D understanding of the world.
<span class="p">
***
</span>
<span class="gs">**Summary:**</span> Diffusion models work by mastering the art of noise removal. Whether working in pixel space (Imagen) or latent space (Stable Diffusion), and using clever tricks like classifier-free guidance, they have revolutionized AI art. However, their struggle with logic (binding) and physics shows we still have work to do!
