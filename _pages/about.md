I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Computer & Information Science Department](https://www.cis.udel.edu/) at the [University of Delaware](https://www.udel.edu/), advised by [Prof. Xi Peng](https://deep-real.github.io/dr_xipeng.html) in the [DeepREAL Lab](https://deep-real.github.io/). 🧠🤖

My research explores **interpretability** and **generalization**, focusing on how a model’s internal structure shapes its ability to generalize across diverse domains. I am especially interested in:

- Interpretable Machine Learning
- Vision-Language Models
- Medical AI 🧬
- Out-of-distribution (OOD) Generalization 🌍

I have published at top-tier conferences such as **ICML** and **CVPR**.

### 🧭 Research Journey

I’m deeply curious about intelligence from both artificial and biological perspectives. My journey started at the intersection of **neuroscience** and **AI**, driven by the fundamental question:

<small><i>
What are the foundational principles that enable generalizable intelligence, in both machines and the human brain?
</i></small>

Previously, I was a Master's student at **Columbia University**, where I conducted research in the [LIINC Lab](https://liinc.bme.columbia.edu/) on **Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI)** and foundation models for interpreting brain signals, advised by Prof. [Paul Sajda](https://liinc.bme.columbia.edu/people/paul-sajda). 🧠⚡

I also interned at the [CHDI Foundation](https://chdifoundation.org/), where I developed segmentation foundation models to support the diagnosis of **Huntington’s Disease** — a progressive neurodegenerative disorder.
