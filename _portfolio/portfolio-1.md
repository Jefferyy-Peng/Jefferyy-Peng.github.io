## Intro
I am interested in intelligence from both artificial and biological perspectives. My research journey began at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence, driven by a fundamental question: What are the foundamental principles that enable generalizable intelligence, both in machines and in the human brain?

Currently, I am a PhD student at the University of Delaware, working in the DeepREAL lab. My research focuses on multimodal interpretability and generalization, particularly exploring how a modelâ€™s internal structure influences its ability to generalize across diverse domains.

Previously, I am a Master student researching Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) and foundation model for interpreting BCI signals at the Liinc Lab at Columbia University. I was also a research intern at CHDI Foundation developing segmentation foundation model for facilitating diagnosis of Huntington's Disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder.

## Research Projects

Then I get traped in research AI for its fascinating capability in various tasks and its good interpretability compared to biological brains. I'm generally interested in how intelligence (which I consider is the generalizability) come into place. My mental model for this now is an analogy to how human evolves:
